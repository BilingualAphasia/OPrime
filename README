A system that will accept a multipart form upload (say, containing an audio file) while displaying a percentage progress.

Specification:

When the user picks a file from their computer and the form is submitted, the upload begins.
While uploading, the status text paragraph should be updating with the
current percentage complete at least once every 2 seconds.
While uploading, the user should be able to enter text into the title
text field.

When the upload completes, the status text should display the path on the server to the saved file, and
the current value of the title text field should be posted to the server. The response to the form post
request should display both the title and the path to the file.
